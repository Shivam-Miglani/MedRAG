Title: US CDC Comprehensive Framework for Type 2 Diabetes Management

The cornerstone of Type 2 diabetes prevention in the United States involves the National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP), a structured, yearlong lifestyle intervention. This program, facilitated by trained coaches, has demonstrated a significant reduction in disease risk for high-risk individuals. Core goals include a modest weight loss of 5-7% of body weight and achieving at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity, like brisk walking, each week. The CDC's dietary guidance promotes the 'plate method' for portion control, focusing on lean proteins and non-starchy vegetables. Metformin is the standard first-line pharmacological treatment.
