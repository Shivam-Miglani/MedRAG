Title: General Cardiovascular Health Guidelines (European Society of Cardiology)

Maintaining cardiovascular health involves regular physical activity, aiming for 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise weekly. Dietary patterns should be rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while limiting sodium and saturated fats. Medications such as statins are often prescribed to manage cholesterol levels, a key risk factor for heart disease. Blood pressure management is also critical. These recommendations are foundational for preventing events like myocardial infarction.
