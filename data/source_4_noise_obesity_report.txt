Title: Public Health Report on Obesity Trends in Western Europe

Recent trends indicate a rising prevalence of obesity across Western Europe, which is a major public health concern. Government initiatives focus on promoting healthier food choices in schools and subsidizing sports club memberships. While pharmacological interventions for weight loss exist, they are typically considered only in cases of severe obesity and after lifestyle modifications have failed. The focus remains on prevention through education and community programs. Metformin is sometimes used off-label in certain patient populations for weight management, but this is not a standard guideline.
